# A Naked Gatsby Theme

## A truly production ready base Gatsby Theme

This theme is called Naked because I didn't tie you to any one type of CSS implementation. At this point you just need to add CSS and you're good to go.

Basically styles can be added to in the (global.css)[/Users/david/Desktop/clients/1001teafacts/blog/src/styles/global.css] file.

Special emphasis has been made to have a proper implementation of Schema.org and SEO best practices. For example, each different blog post, has it's own blog post schema.
